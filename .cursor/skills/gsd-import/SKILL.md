## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-import` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Cursor tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `Shell` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `StrReplace` for editing existing files
- `Read`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `TodoWrite` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use `Task(subagent_type="generalPurpose", ...)`
- The `model` parameter maps to Cursor's model options (e.g., "fast")

<objective>
Import external plan files into the GSD planning system with conflict detection against PROJECT.md decisions.

- **--from**: Import an external plan file, detect conflicts, write as GSD PLAN.md, validate via gsd-plan-checker.
- **--from-gsd2**: Reverse-migrate a GSD-2 project (`.gsd/` directory) back to GSD v1 (`.planning/`) format. Runs `gsd-tools.cjs from-gsd2`. Pass `--path <dir>` to migrate a project at a different path.
</objective>

<process>
If `--from-gsd2` is in {{GSD_ARGS}}:
Run: `node "/Users/mali/Development/xai-bookkeeping/.cursor/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" from-gsd2`
Pass `--path <dir>` if provided. Present the migration result to the user.
Stop here (do not run the standard import workflow).

Otherwise, execute the import workflow end-to-end.
